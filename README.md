## Abstract
Underactuation is desirable in walking robots
but increases difficulty of control. This paper compares the
performance of a computed torque method (CMT) controller
and a sliding mode control (SMC) controller in the tracking
of a human-like walking trajectory for a fully actuated biped
robot with knees. Results are given for progressively decreasing
ankle torque limits to demonstrate the poor performance of
the controllers in an underactuated robot; the controllers are
also compared under parameter uncertainty to compare their
robustness.
